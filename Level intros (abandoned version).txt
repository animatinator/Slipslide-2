Size should be 480*384; 80% of the full screen size. The
background is animated clouds, with the text window being
slightly transparent (lines alternating between near-opaque
and near-invisible blues in the style of Pash's pause menu).
The text window is made up of five pieces: the four corners,
and a 1*2 pixel piece which is tiled across the remaining
size of the window. The topmost pixel of this is the standard
blue with 80% opacity, the bottom is the same but with 40%
opacity.
